Secure Session and Token Management in Node.js Express
This project is a Node.js Express application implementing secure session and token management, adhering to Clean Code principles and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). It leverages Redis (Amazon MemoryDB) for session storage, JWT for token-based authentication, and includes various security measures like CSRF protection, rate limiting, and HTTPS enforcement.

Features
Session Creation and Management
Unique session IDs stored in Redis with associated user data.
HTTP-only cookies for session IDs to prevent XSS attacks.
Session expiration policies with sliding sessions for continuous activity.
Token Management
Short-lived JWT tokens for API access.
Token refresh mechanism while the session is active.
Security Measures
CSRF protection using tokens stored in Redis.
Rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks.
Mandatory HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
Scalability
Utilizes Redis (Amazon MemoryDB) for in-memory session storage.
Connect-Redis integration with Express-Session middleware.

Redis instance (Amazon MemoryDB recommended)
HTTPS Certificate (for production)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-session-token-management.git
cd secure-session-token-management
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configuration
Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

dotenv
Copy code
PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=6379
NODE_ENV=development
Replace your_session_secret and your_jwt_secret with secure, random strings.
Set REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT to your Redis instance's host and port.
Change NODE_ENV to production when deploying.
Redis Configuration

Ensure your Redis instance (Amazon MemoryDB) is accessible and properly configured for session storage and data persistence.

Running the Application
Start the Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
Access the Application

The server will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.
Use an API client like Postman to interact with the endpoints.
Environment Variables
Variable	Description
PORT	Port on which the server will run (default: 3000)
SESSION_SECRET	Secret key for session encryption
JWT_SECRET	Secret key for JWT token signing
REDIS_HOST	Hostname or IP address of your Redis instance
REDIS_PORT	Port number of your Redis instance (default: 6379)
NODE_ENV	Environment mode (development or production)
Security Considerations
CSRF Protection

Implemented using the csurf middleware. CSRF tokens are generated and validated for sensitive operations.

Rate Limiting

Applied using express-rate-limit to limit the number of requests to sensitive routes, mitigating brute-force attacks.

HTTPS Enforcement

In production mode, the application enforces HTTPS.
Secure cookies (httpOnly, secure) are used to store session IDs.
Data Encryption

All data in transit is encrypted using HTTPS. Ensure SSL certificates are properly configured in a production environment.

Redis Configuration
Session Storage

Sessions are stored in Redis using the connect-redis package, providing fast in-memory storage and scalability.

Eviction Policies

Configure Redis with appropriate eviction policies to handle expired sessions, such as volatile-ttl or allkeys-lru.

Data Persistence

Enable Redis persistence using Append-Only File (AOF) or snapshotting (RDB) to recover data in case of crashes.
For Amazon MemoryDB, configure automatic snapshots and backups as per your requirements.
